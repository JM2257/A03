Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.
Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

Part 2:
- **Branch** A seperate working copy of the master git repository, used when adding features to the master branch without interfering with other colaborators local versions.
